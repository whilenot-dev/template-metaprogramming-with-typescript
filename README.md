# Metaprogramming with TypeScript

This is the playground for a [blog post](https://blog.whilenot.dev/posts/metaprogramming-with-typescript/). It consists of 3 scripts that demo how one could metaprogram with TypeScript.

Have fun!

## Usage

Launch the scripts one-by-one and inspect their output:

```bash
$ npm run -s start:1
```

```bash
$ npm run -s start:2
```

```bash
$ npm run -s start:3
```
